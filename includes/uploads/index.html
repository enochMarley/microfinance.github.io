					<div>
						<p>An algorithm is a concise sequence of instructions to be performed within a finite amount of time and space. When an algorithm is invoked, it runs step by step, until all the instructions are executed.<br>
						Every algorithm has <b>time complexity</b> , which is the total amount of time it takes to finish execution, and <b>space complexity</b>, which is the total amount of memory space it requires to execute.Also, every algorithm has cases of complexity which are <b>best case, average case and worst case.</b><br>
						The best case of an algorithm is the fastest time the algorithm takes to finish execution. This mostly happens when optimal inputs are chosen.For instance, the best case of a sorting algorithm will occur when the input for the algorithm is data that is already sorted. In this case the algorithm will execute fast because it wouldn't need to do any sorting of the input.<br>
						The average case of an algorithm is the arithmetic mean of the time of execution. Here the algorithm is run several times using different inputs and the running time for each input is calculated. The running times for all the inputs are added and the divided by the number of trials. <br>
						The worst case of an algorithm is the slowest time it takes for the algorithm to complete execution. For instance, the worst case of a sorting algorithm will occur when the input is reverse sorted data  <br>
						 The subject of discussion today is the <b>Bubble Sort Algorithm</b>.

						<a href="#definition" data-toggle='collapse'>What Is The Bubble Sort Algorithm ?</a><br><br>
						<div id="definition" class="collapse">
							<p>The bubble sort  is a sorting algorithm. The algorithm cycles and compares each pair of adjacent elements in a list and swaps them if they are not in order. The elements of the list gradually 'bubble' to their right position in the list.</p><br>
						</div>

						<a href="#howItWorks" data-toggle='collapse'>How Does The Bubble Sort Algorithm Work?</a><br><br>
						<div id="howItWorks" class="collapse">
							<p>Bubble Sort Algorithm cycles through a list and analyzes each pair of elements of that list from left to right, or from the beginning to the end of the list. It passes (iterates the list n times, where n is the number of elements in the list) and switches (iterates pairs of elements of the list in each pass). In each pair analyzed, if the element on the left side less than the element on the right side, the pair will remain the same and the next two pair will be analyzed. On the other hand, if the element on the left side greater than the element on the right side, their positions are switched, and the next two pair of elements are analyzed. The cycles iterates until a pass where no switch occurs.<br>
							As an example, consider the unsorted list of numbers <b>A = [4, 11, 2, 8, 14]</b>. This is how the Bubble Sort Algorithm will sort the numbers. <br><br>
							<b>Pass 1:</b><br>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Switch 1</b> :<span class="shift"></span> <span class="isGreen">4</span>, <span class="isGreen">11</span>, 2, 8, 14.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 4 is less than 11.</li>

								<li><b>Switch 2</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 4, <span class='isRed'>2</span>, <span class='isRed'>11</span>, 8, 14.<span class="shift"></span> 2 and 11 are switched because 2 is less than 11.</li> 

								<li><b>Switch 3</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 4, 2, <span class='isRed'>8</span>, <span class='isRed'>11</span>, 14.<span class="shift"></span> 8 and 11 are switched because 8 is less than 11.</li>

								<li><b>Switch 4</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 4, 2, 8 <span class='isGreen'>11</span>, <span class='isGreen'>14</span>.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 11 is less than 14.</li>
							</ul>
							After pass 1 the updated list is A = [4, 2, 8, 11, 14]. Now we will proceed to pass 2. <br><br>

							<b>Pass 2:</b><br>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Switch 1</b> :<span class="shift"></span> <span class="isRed">2</span>, <span class="isRed">4</span>, 8, 11, 14.<span class="shift"></span> 2 and 4 are switched because 2 is less than 4.</li>

								<li><b>Switch 2</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 2, <span class='isGreen'>4</span>, <span class='isGreen'>8</span>, 11, 14.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 4 is less than 8.</li> 

								<li><b>Switch 3</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 2, 4, <span class='isGreen'>8</span>, <span class='isGreen'>11</span>, 14.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 8 is less than 11.</li>

								<li><b>Switch 4</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 2, 4, 8 <span class='isGreen'>11</span>, <span class='isGreen'>14</span>.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 11 is less than 14.</li>
							</ul>
							After pass 2 the updated list is A = [2, 4, 8, 11, 14]. Now we will proceed to pass 3.<br><br>

							<b>Pass 3:</b><br>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Switch 1</b> :<span class="shift"></span> <span class="isGreen">2</span>, <span class="isGreen">4</span>, 8, 11, 14.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 2 is less than 4.</li>

								<li><b>Switch 2</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 2, <span class='isGreen'>4</span>, <span class='isGreen'>8</span>, 11, 14.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 4 is less than 8.</li> 

								<li><b>Switch 3</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 2, 4, <span class='isGreen'>8</span>, <span class='isGreen'>11</span>, 14.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 8 is less than 11.</li>

								<li><b>Switch 4</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 2, 4, 8 <span class='isGreen'>11</span>, <span class='isGreen'>14</span>.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 11 is less than 14.</li>
							</ul>
							After pass 3 the updated list is A = [2, 4, 8, 11, 14]. Now we will proceed to pass 4.<br><br>

							<b>Pass 4:</b><br>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Switch 1</b> :<span class="shift"></span> <span class="isGreen">2</span>, <span class="isGreen">4</span>, 8, 11, 14.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 2 is less than 4.</li>

								<li><b>Switch 2</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 2, <span class='isGreen'>4</span>, <span class='isGreen'>8</span>, 11, 14.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 4 is less than 8.</li> 

								<li><b>Switch 3</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 2, 4, <span class='isGreen'>8</span>, <span class='isGreen'>11</span>, 14.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 8 is less than 11.</li>

								<li><b>Switch 4</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 2, 4, 8 <span class='isGreen'>11</span>, <span class='isGreen'>14</span>.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 11 is less than 14.</li>
							</ul>
							After pass 4 the updated list is A = [2, 4, 8, 11, 14]. Now we will proceed to pass 5, which is the final pass. <br><br>
							

							<b>Pass 5:</b><br>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Switch 1</b> :<span class="shift"></span> <span class="isGreen">2</span>, <span class="isGreen">4</span>, 8, 11, 14.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 2 is less than 4.</li>

								<li><b>Switch 2</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 2, <span class='isGreen'>4</span>, <span class='isGreen'>8</span>, 11, 14.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 4 is less than 8.</li> 

								<li><b>Switch 3</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 2, 4, <span class='isGreen'>8</span>, <span class='isGreen'>11</span>, 14.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 8 is less than 11.</li>

								<li><b>Switch 4</b> :<span class="shift"></span> 2, 4, 8 <span class='isGreen'>11</span>, <span class='isGreen'>14</span>.<span class="shift"></span> No switching occurs because 11 is less than 14.</li>
							</ul>
							After pass 5 the final list is A = [2, 4, 8, 11, 14]. <br>
							It can be observed that after the 5 passes and 4 switches in each pass, the unsorted list <b>A = [4, 11, 2, 8, 14]</b> was sorted to <b>A = [2, 4, 8, 11, 14]</b> using the Bubble Sort algorithm.  <a href="#howItWorks" data-toggle='collapse'>Close</a></p><br>

							<p>
								The time complexities of the algorithm are: <br>
								<b>Best case : O(n).</b> This is the case of already sorted list.</sup><br>
								<b>Average case : O(n <sup>2</sup>).</sup></b><br>
								<b>Worst case : O(n <sup>2</sup>).</b> There will be n passes through the list, and each pass will have n-1 switches</sup><br>
								<b>n</b> is the number of items. <br><br>
								The Bubble Sort algorithm is memory efficient because the all switches are done within the list itself. There is no new allocation of memory space. Also no new data structures are needed.
